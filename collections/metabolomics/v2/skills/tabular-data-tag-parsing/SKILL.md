# tabular-data-tag-parsing

## Summary

Parse tagged tabular files (Excel or CSV) into nested JSON by interpreting export tags (prefixed with # or #.) in column headers to map table names, record identifiers, and field names. This extraction step converts raw experimental metadata spreadsheets into a standardized, interoperable JSON representation suitable for downstream validation and format conversion.

## When to use

You have raw tabular experimental data (CSV or Excel) with column headers annotated using MESSES tag syntax (#<table_name>.id for record identifiers, #.<field_name> for field values), and you need to transform it into a nested JSON structure that conforms to the Experiment Description Specification for validation and repository submission.

## When NOT to use

- Input tabular data has no tagging layer or uses a different tagging convention incompatible with MESSES syntax
- Data is already in valid JSON format and only needs validation or conversion, not extraction
- Tabular data structure does not follow a record-based model (e.g., purely columnar, matrix-like experimental data without identifiable records or tables)

## Inputs

- tagged tabular file (CSV or Excel format)
- column headers with MESSES export tags (#<table_name>.id, #.<field_name>)
- tabular rows with experimental metadata and measurements

## Outputs

- nested JSON structure with table names as top-level keys
- records indexed by identifier within each table
- field key-value pairs within each record
- intermediate JSON representation conforming to Experiment Description Specification

## How to apply

Read the tagged tabular file row-by-row and parse each column header to extract tag syntax: identify # or #. prefixes, then extract the table name and field name (or record identifier marker) from the tag string. Build a hierarchical JSON dictionary by iterating through rows: for each row, create or append records keyed by table name and record identifier (from columns marked #<table_name>.id), populating field key-value pairs from columns marked #.<field_name>. Validate that all tagged columns conform to expected syntax (either #<table_name>.id or #.<field_name>) and that no duplicate record identifiers exist within a single table before outputting the nested JSON. The MESSES extract command automates this process and produces intermediate JSON ready for downstream validation and conversion steps.

- **MESSES** (Python package that automates tagged tabular extraction via the 'extract' command, handling tag parsing, JSON serialization, and validation against Experiment Description Specification) — https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/messes
- **Python** (Programming language for implementing tag parsing logic, JSON object construction, and row-by-row file iteration)
- **jsonschema** (Post-extraction validation tool for verifying the produced nested JSON against the Experiment Description Specification and Protocol Dependent Schema) — https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/

## Examples

```
messes extract your_data.csv --output your_data.json
```

## Evaluation signals

- All tagged columns in the input are successfully parsed and no tag syntax errors or unrecognized prefixes remain in the output
- The output nested JSON structure has correct hierarchy: table names at top level, records keyed by identifier within each table, field key-value pairs within records
- No duplicate record identifiers exist within a single table (validate uniqueness of #<table_name>.id values per table)
- The output JSON validates successfully against the Experiment Description Specification using jsonschema
- All rows from the input tabular file are represented in the output JSON with no data loss

## Limitations

- Tag parsing assumes strict adherence to MESSES tag syntax (#<table_name>.id and #.<field_name>); malformed, missing, or non-standard tags will cause parsing errors or data loss
- The skill requires prior manual or automated tagging of the raw tabular data; untagged spreadsheets cannot be processed without first applying the tagging layer
- Duplicate record identifiers within a table will be flagged as an error; the user must resolve identifier conflicts in the source data before extraction succeeds
- The approach is specific to record-oriented (relational) data models; purely columnar or matrix-based experimental data (e.g., omics feature tables) may not map cleanly to the nested table-record-field structure

## Evidence

- [other] Tagged tabular files are converted to nested JSON by mapping each table column with #<table_name>.id tags to record names and each column with #.<field_name> tags to field names and values, producing a JSON structure where table names contain records with field key-value pairs.: "Tagged tabular files are converted to nested JSON by mapping each table column with #<table_name>.id tags to record names and each column with #.<field_name> tags to field names and values, producing"
- [other] Extract tabular data into JSON using tags. This is done by adding a layer of tags on top of the data.: "The extract command of MESSES supports turning tabular data into JSON. This is done by adding a layer of tags on top of the data."
- [readme] Simply add a layer of tags to any tabular data and MESSES can transform it into an intermediate JSON representation: "Simply add a layer of tags to any tabular data and MESSES can transform it into an intermediate JSON representation and then convert it to any of the supported formats."
- [readme] MESSES breaks up the process into 3 steps: extract, validate, and convert. The extraction step adds a layer of tags to your raw tabular data, which may be automatable, and then extracts it into a JSONized form that it is more interoperable and more standardized.: "MESSES breaks up the process into 3 steps: extract, validate, and convert.
